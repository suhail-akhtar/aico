"""The declarative base, with a naming convention for every constraint.

Unnamed constraints get database-generated names that differ between PostgreSQL
and SQLite, which makes a later `ALTER`/`DROP CONSTRAINT` migration impossible to
write portably. A convention gives every index, key and check a predictable name
from day one.
